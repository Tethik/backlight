## Install

For x64 you can download and install the released binary with the following script.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Tethik/backlight/releases/latest/download/backlight
wget https://github.com/Tethik/backlight/releases/latest/download/backlight-completion.sh
chmod +x backlight
sudo mv backlight /usr/local/bin/backlight
sudo setcap cap_dac_override+ep /usr/local/bin/backlight
sudo mv backlight-completion.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/backlight
```

### Build from source

Requires that you have golang installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/Tethik/backlight
make
sudo make install
```

_Why sudo?_ To allow the program access to sysfs from a normal user the install script sets `cap_dac_override`.

### i3 configuration

I originally built this for my own i3 setup. The following is the configuration I use to
bind the brightness keys on my laptop to run this backlight program.

```
# Sreen brightness controls
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec backlight inc intel_backlight 50
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec backlight dec intel_backlight 50
```
